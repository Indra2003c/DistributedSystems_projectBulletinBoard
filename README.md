There are two ways to run the project. The simplest way is to start the server by executing the run_server.bat. After that you can start as many clients as you want by executing the run_client.bat.   


In case this doesn't work you can start the Server.jar and Client.jar manually. You need to go to the directory of the project in your cmd and run following commands.  \
To start the server: \
>java -jar --enable-preview Server.jar

To start the client:  \
>java -jar --enable-preview Client.jar

These are the same commands that are executed in the .bat-scripts.  


You can also go into the Server (or Client) directory and run the Server.java (or client.java) in the project itself.
